\title{Remove or Replace non-numeric characters.}
\usage{
swapc(c, re = "[Kk]", repl = "0")

scrubc(c, re = "[^-.0-9]")
}
\arguments{
\item{c}{A character vector of potentially numeric values.}

\item{re}{A regular expression specifying which characters to operate on. For best effect,
re should begin with "[" and end with "]" to specify a character set. At some point, I'll add
a check to enforce this.}

\item{repl}{A single character to be used as a replacement.}
}
\description{
\code{swapc()} replaces non-numeric characters with numeric.

\code{scrubc()} removes non-numeric characters from test scores.
}
\details{
\code{swapc()} replaces one character in a string with another in
anticipation of converting to numeric. One use-case is to replace
"K" with "0" in grade-equivalent test scores.
These sometimes occur in otherwise numeric standardized test scores.
Report the number of such characters replaced. Characters to be replaced
are specified by regular expression (re).

\code{scrubc()} removes non-numeric characters from test scores,
often present due to fat-fingered data entry, in anticipation of converting to numeric.
Report the number of such characters removed. Characters to be removed are specified by regular expression (re).
The default re is "[^-.0-9]", which will remove all non-numeric characters at one swoop.

A typical use case in interactive use is to remove exactly 1 specific character at a time, e.g.,
\code{scrubc(c=c("*K.1", "K.8", "1.6", "2.1", "3.0", ">12.9"), re="[>]")}. This serves to alert
the analyst to how many of each non-numeric character removed.
}
\examples{
c = c("<K.1", "K.8", "1.6", "2.1", "3.0", ">12.9")
swap(c)

c <- c("0.1", "_0.8", "1.6", "2.1`", "+3. 0", "12.9")
scrubc(c)
