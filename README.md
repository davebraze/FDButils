The FDButils package holds a grab-bag of utility functions used by FDB. It includes few dependencies beyond the R 'base' and 'recommended' packages, but do see DESCRIPTION file for a handful of others. In general, FDButils and its dependencies should be pretty stable.


Install with remotes::install\_github():
